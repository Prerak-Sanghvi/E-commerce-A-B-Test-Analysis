# E-commerce A/B Test Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes A/B test results from an e-commerce website to determine whether implementing a new landing page increases user conversion rates. Key steps included:  
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis.  
- Hypothesis testing (simulation, z-test) to compare conversion rates.  
- Logistic regression to control for confounding variables (e.g., user location).  

## Key Findings  
- **No significant difference** in conversion rates between old and new pages (p-value > 0.05).  
- Geographic location (US, UK, Canada) had **no material impact** on conversions.  
- Recommendations: Retain the old page or extend testing to account for change/novelty effects.
